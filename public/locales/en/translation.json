        "title_tire": "Warranty for Cervo Tires",
        "desc_tire": "<p>There are several types of warranties that come with the tires: Manufacturing Defects Warranty and Mileage Warranty. All tires come with a basic warranty against manufacturing defects. Here is additional information to help you understand the different warranties and how to proceed when making a warranty claim:<br/>Manufacturing Defects Warranty: All tires have a certain basic warranty against defects arising during tire manufacture. This includes defects in workmanship or material for the life of the tire (up to 2/32 of the tread). Generally, unrounded tires are an isolated case of one tire not balancing. This should be detected quickly after the tire has been installed on the vehicle. The length of the manufacturer's defect warranty depends on the manufacturer and the type of tire.<br/>Mileage Warranties: The mileage warranty is determined by the tire manufacturer based on the average number of miles expected for the tire. To successfully file a mileage warranty, you must be able to provide the following: Installation records with mileage, rotation and mileage records when the tire is removed from the vehicle. To qualify for the mileage warranty, tires must be uniformly worn and have a tread balance of 2/32 or less. Your papers and tire(s) will be examined and measured. If so, you will receive credit for unused mileage under warranty.</p>",
        "title_wheel": "Warranty for Cervo Wheels",
        "desc_wheel": "<p>All purchased discs are covered by a 12-month manufacturer's warranty, subject to the Buyer's compliance with all the provisions specified in the instructions accompanying the product.<br/><br/>The warranty is valid from the date of purchase (delivery). When you receive the discs, it is necessary to inspect them in detail for visual defects. No complaints about the appearance of the discs will be accepted after signing the sales receipt.<br/><br/>THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY:<br/>- Defects caused by installing the wrong size rims or on a vehicle not regulated by the manufacturer;<br/>- Deformation due to improper operation (exceeding the permissible weight or shock loads from dropping the machine into a pit, hitting a foreign object or a curbstone, etc.);<br/>- Partial or complete loss of paint coating in case of improper storage of discs or mechanical influences;<br/>- Damage to the disc or its coating during insertion or installation on the vehicle;<br/>- Appearance of cosmetic defects resulting from the use of chemicals as cleaning agents (chrome-plated and painted discs);<br/>- Occurrence of defects caused by an emergency situation;<br/>- Discoloration or swelling of the paintwork as a result of winter de-icing agents being applied to the wheels.<br/><br/>CONDITIONS OF USE OF AUTOMOBILE DISCS:<br/>- The size of the discs you install on the car must be regulated by the manufacturer.<br/>- Before putting on the discs, they should be tried on (without tires!) to the car on the front and rear hub axles to check that all mounting holes match and that the disc will not touch the car parts when rotating.<br/>- Paint defects and corrosion caused by improper care and the use of chemicals to clean the rims are not grounds for a warranty claim.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CARE OF LIGHT-ALLOY WHEELS:<br/>Chromed and painted rims: To keep the paint finish as long as possible, always clean the rim with only mild water-based detergents. Avoid contact with salt, brake dust, gasoline, and chemical-based detergents commonly used in touch-free car washes.<br/>Polished rims: We recommend using only mild detergent automotive cleaners for cleaning. Use an aluminum metal polish to maintain and enhance the shine.</p>"
